You must follow that order's edicts, or you lose access to Cavalier Dedication and all other feats in this archetype. Determine the specifics of your order's edicts with your GM. You gain the service of a trained mount, which is treated as a young animal companion (see page 284). Normally, you can choose only an animal companion with the mount special ability, such as a horse. The GM might allow you to select another type of animal companion appropriate to your ancestry and culture, but that animal companion doesn't gain the mount special ability. Special You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the cavalier archetype.
