ABILITY:Alchemist Class Feat|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Class Feat|KEY:Alchemist Feat ~ Calculated Splash|TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat.FEAT 04|DESC:You have calculated all the angles to maximize a bomb's splash.

ABILITY:Alchemist Class Feat|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Class Feat|KEY:Alchemist Feat ~ Directional Bombs|TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat.FEAT 06|DESC:You can lob bombs with great force and a precise trajectory to angle the splash in a cone spraying in a single direction. When throwing an alchemical bomb with the splash trait, instead of splashing all squares adjacent to the target, you can treat the target's space as the first affected square of a 15-foot cone directed away from you, potentially allowing you to avoid allies and splash deeper into enemy lines. If the target takes up more than a single square, the target's square closest to you is the first affected square of the cone.
ABILITY:Alchemist Class Feat|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Class Feat|KEY:Alchemist Feat ~ Expanded Splash|TYPE:Alchemist Class Feat.Class Feat.FEAT 10|DESC:The particularly volatile compounds that you brew into your bombs result in them creating especially large and powerful explosions.

A creature that takes a direct hit from one of your sticky bombs also takes persistent damage equal to and of the same type as the bomb's splash damage. If the bomb already deals persistent damage, combine the two amounts.
