ABILITY:Rogue's Racket|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Class Feature|KEY:Rogue Class Feature ~ Ruffian|TYPE:Rogue Class Feature.Class Feature.Display.Rogue's Racket|DESC:You prefer to strong-arm or intimidate others rather than rely on finesse or fancy tricks.

If you're legendary in Acrobatics, you always land on your feet and don't take damage, regardless of the distance of the fall.
ABILITY:Skill Feat|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:FEAT|KEY:Experienced Smuggler|TYPE:General.Skill|DESC:You often smuggle things past the authorities. When the GM rolls your Stealth check to see if a passive observer notices a small item you have concealed, the GM uses the number rolled or 10-whichever is higher-as the result of your die roll, adding it to your Stealth modifier to determine your Stealth check result. If you're a master in Stealth, the GM uses the number rolled or 15, and if you're legendary in Stealth, you automatically succeed at hiding a small concealed item from passive observers. This provides no benefits when a creature attempts a Perception check while actively searching you for hidden items.

ABILITY:Skill Feat|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:FEAT|KEY:Kip Up|TYPE:General.Skill|DESC:You stand up. This movement doesn't trigger reactions.
ABILITY:Skill Feat|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:FEAT|KEY:Lasting Coercion|TYPE:General.Skill|DESC:When you successfully Coerce someone, the maximum time they comply increases to a week, still determined by the GM. If you're legendary, the maximum increases to a month.
ABILITY:Skill Feat|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:FEAT|KEY:Nimble Crawl|TYPE:General.Skill|DESC:You can Crawl incredibly swiftly - up to half your Speed, rather than 5 feet. If you're a master in Acrobatics, you can Crawl at full Speed, and if you're legendary, you aren't flat-footed while prone.
ABILITY:Skill Feat|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:FEAT|KEY:Pickpocket|TYPE:General.Skill|DESC:You can Steal or Palm an Object that's closely guarded, such as in a pocket, without taking the -5 penalty. You can't steal objects that would be extremely noticeable or time consuming to remove (like worn shoes or armor or actively wielded objects). If you're a master in Thievery, you can attempt to Steal from a creature in combat or otherwise on guard.

ABILITY:Skill Feat|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:FEAT|KEY:Streetwise|TYPE:General.Skill|DESC:You know about life on the streets and feel the pulse of your local settlement. You can use your Society modifier instead of your Diplomacy modifier to Gather Information. In any settlement you frequent regularly, you can use the Recall Knowledge action with Society to know the same sorts of information that you could discover with Diplomacy to Gather Information. The DC is usually significantly higher, but you know the information without spending time gathering it. If you fail to recall the information, you can still subsequently attempt to Gather Information normally.
