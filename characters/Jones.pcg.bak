You gain the trained proficiency rank in Acrobatics and Stealth. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in Halfling Lore.

Eventually, that curiosity led you to leave your studies and become an adventurer. Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost. Choose Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion; you gain the Assurance skill feat in your chosen skill. You're trained in the Academia Lore skill.

You might be a grifter or con artist, traveling from place to place with a new story or scheme. Your racket is also ideal for certain reputable professions, like barrister, diplomat, or politician. When you successfully Feint (page 246), the target is flat-footed against melee attacks you attempt against it until the end of your next turn. On a critical success, the target is flat-footed against all melee attacks until the end of your next turn, not just yours. You're trained in Deception and Diplomacy. You can choose Charisma as your key ability score.
