ABILITY:Rogue Class Feat|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Class Feat|KEY:ALCHEMIST DEDICATION|TYPE:FEAT 2.ARCHETYPE DEDICATION.MULTICLASS|DESC:You put your alchemical interest into practice. You become trained in alchemical bombs and Crafting; if you were already trained in Crafting, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You become trained in alchemist class DC. You gain the alchemist�s infused reagents class feature, gaining a number of reagents each day equal to your level.

Your advanced alchemy level is 1 and doesn�t increase on its own. Special You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the alchemist archetype.
ABILITY:Rogue Class Feat|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Class Feat|KEY:Rogue Feat ~ Trap Finder|TYPE:Rogue Class Feat.Class Feat.FEAT 1.ROGUE|DESC:You have an intuitive sense that alerts you to the dangers and presence of traps. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to find traps, to AC against attacks made by traps, and to saves against traps. Even if you aren't Searching, you get a check to find traps that normally require you to be Searching. You still need to meet any other requirements to find the trap.

ABILITY:Rogue's Racket|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:Class Feature|KEY:Rogue Class Feature ~ Scoundrel|TYPE:Rogue Class Feature.Class Feature.Display.Rogue's Racket|DESC:You use fast-talking, flattery, and a silver tongue to avoid danger and escape tricky situations. You might be a grifter or con artist, traveling from place to place with a new story or scheme. Your racket is also ideal for certain reputable professions, like barrister, diplomat, or politician. When you successfully Feint (page 246), the target is flat-footed against melee attacks you attempt against it until the end of your next turn. On a critical success, the target is flat-footed against all melee attacks until the end of your next turn, not just yours. You're trained in Deception and Diplomacy. You can choose Charisma as your key ability score.
USERPOOL:Rogue's Racket|POOLPOINTS:0.0
ABILITY:Skill Feat|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:FEAT|KEY:Arcane Sense|TYPE:General.Skill|DESC:Your study of magic allows you to instinctively sense its presence. You can cast 1st-level detect magic at will as an arcane innate spell. If you're a master in Arcana, the spell is heightened to 3rd level; if you're legendary, it is heightened to 4th level.
ABILITY:Skill Feat|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:FEAT|KEY:Experienced Smuggler|TYPE:General.Skill|DESC:You often smuggle things past the authorities. When the GM rolls your Stealth check to see if a passive observer notices a small item you have concealed, the GM uses the number rolled or 10-whichever is higher-as the result of your die roll, adding it to your Stealth modifier to determine your Stealth check result. If you're a master in Stealth, the GM uses the number rolled or 15, and if you're legendary in Stealth, you automatically succeed at hiding a small concealed item from passive observers. This provides no benefits when a creature attempts a Perception check while actively searching you for hidden items. Due to your smuggling skill, you're more likely to find more lucrative smuggling jobs when using Underworld Lore to Earn Income.
ABILITY:Skill Feat|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:FEAT|KEY:Hobnobber|TYPE:General.Skill|DESC:You are skilled at learning information through conversation. The Gather Information exploration activity takes you half as long as normal (typically reducing the time to 1 hour). If you're a master in Diplomacy and you Gather Information at the normal speed, when you attempt to do so and roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead. There is still no guarantee that a rumor you learn with Gather Information is accurate.
ABILITY:Skill Feat|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:FEAT|KEY:Streetwise|TYPE:General.Skill|DESC:You know about life on the streets and feel the pulse of your local settlement. You can use your Society modifier instead of your Diplomacy modifier to Gather Information. In any settlement you frequent regularly, you can use the Recall Knowledge action with Society to know the same sorts of information that you could discover with Diplomacy to Gather Information. The DC is usually significantly higher, but you know the information without spending time gathering it. If you fail to recall the information, you can still subsequently attempt to Gather Information normally.
ABILITY:Skill Feat|TYPE:NORMAL|CATEGORY:FEAT|KEY:Virtuosic Performer|TYPE:General.Skill|DESC:You have exceptional talent with one type of performance. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus when making a certain type of performance. If you are a master in Performance, this bonus increases to +2. Select one of the following specialties and apply the bonus when attempting Performance checks of that type. If it's unclear whether the specialty applies, the GM decides.
